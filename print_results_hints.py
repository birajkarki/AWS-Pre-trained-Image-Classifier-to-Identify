# PROGRAMMER: 
# DATE CREATED:
# REVISED DATE: 
# PURPOSE: This is a *hints* file to help guide students in creating the 
#          function print_results that prints the results statistics from the
#          results statistics dictionary (results_stats_dic). It should also
#          allow the user to be able to print out cases of misclassified
#          dogs and cases of misclassified breeds of dog using the Results 
#          dictionary (results_dic).  
#         This function inputs:
#            -The results dictionary as results_dic within print_results 
#             function and results for the function call within main.
#            -The results statistics dictionary as results_stats_dic within 
#             print_results function and results_stats for the function call within main.
#            -The CNN model architecture as model wihtin print_results function
#             and in_arg.arch for the function call within main. 
#            -Prints Incorrectly Classified Dogs as print_incorrect_dogs within
#             print_results function and set as either boolean value True or 
#             False in the function call within main (defaults to False)
#            -Prints Incorrectly Classified Breeds as print_incorrect_breed within
#             print_results function and set as either boolean value True or 
#             False in the function call within main (defaults to False)
#         This function does not output anything other than printing a summary
#         of the final results.
